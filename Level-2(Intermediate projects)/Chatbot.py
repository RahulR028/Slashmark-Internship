"""//This code implements a basic chatbot named Bard. It can greet users, respond to simple questions, and engage in casual conversation.//

Features:

*Greetings and introductions
*Basic information about Bard
*Responses to common questions ("how are you", "what can you do")
*Light humor (tells a joke)
*Handles thanks and goodbyes
*Some informative responses (weather facts, historical events)
*Conversation starters for further interaction

Current Limitations:

*Cannot access real-time information (weather, news)
*Cannot perform actions in the real world
*Limited knowledge about specific topics (movies, recipes)

Running the Code:


1.Save the code as a Python file (e.g., bard.py).
2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3.Run the script using python bard.py.
4.The chatbot will prompt you for input ("You: "). Type your message and press Enter.
5.Bard will respond to your message ("Bard: ").
5.Type "quit" and press Enter to exit the conversation.

Further Development:

/*cThis code provides a foundation for a more advanced chatbot. You can extend its capabilities by:

Integrating libraries for real-time information access (weather, news).
Adding functionalities like searching recipes or finding local events.
Expanding knowledge base on various topics.*/
